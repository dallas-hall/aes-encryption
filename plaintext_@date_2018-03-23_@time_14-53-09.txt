UTF-8 is an ASCII-preserving encoding method for Unicode (ISO 10646), the Universal Character Set (UCS). The UCS encodes most of the world's writing systems in a single character set, allowing you to mix languages and scripts within a document without needing any tricks for switching character sets. This web page is encoded directly in UTF-8.

As shown HERE, Columbia University's Kermit 95 terminal emulation software can display UTF-8 plain text in Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, XP, Vista, or Windows 7/8/10 when using a monospace Unicode font like Andale Mono WT J or Everson Mono Terminal, or the lesser populated Courier New, Lucida Console, or Andale Mono. C-Kermit can handle it too, if you have a Unicode display. As many languages as are representable in your font can be seen on the screen at the same time.

This, however, is a Web page, which started out as a kind of stress test for UTF-8 support in Web browsers, which was spotty when this page was first created in the 1990s but which has become standard in all modern browsers. The problem now is mainly the fonts and the browser's (or font's) support for the nonzero Unicode planes (as in, e.g., the Braille and Gothic examples below). And to some extent the rendition of combining sequences, right-to-left rendition (Arabic, Hebrew), and so on. CLICK HERE for a survey of Unicode fonts for Windows.

The subtitle above shows currency symbols of many lands. If they don't appear as blobs, we're off to a good start!

From Laȝamon's Brut (The Chronicles of England, Middle English, West Midlands, ca.1190):

    An preost wes on leoden, Laȝamon was ihoten
    He wes Leovenaðes sone -- liðe him be Drihten.
    He wonede at Ernleȝe at æðelen are chirechen,
    Uppen Sevarne staþe, sel þar him þuhte,
    Onfest Radestone, þer he bock radde.

From the Tagelied of Wolfram von Eschenbach (Middle High German):

    Sîne klâwen durh die wolken sint geslagen,
    er stîget ûf mit grôzer kraft,
    ich sih in grâwen tägelîch als er wil tagen,
    den tac, der im geselleschaft
    erwenden wil, dem werden man,
    den ich mit sorgen în verliez.
    ich bringe in hinnen, ob ich kan.
    sîn vil manegiu tugent michz leisten hiez.

Some lines of Odysseus Elytis (Greek):

    Monotonic:

    Τη γλώσσα μου έδωσαν ελληνική
    το σπίτι φτωχικό στις αμμουδιές του Ομήρου.
    Μονάχη έγνοια η γλώσσα μου στις αμμουδιές του Ομήρου.

    από το Άξιον Εστί
    του Οδυσσέα Ελύτη
    	Polytonic:

    Τὴ γλῶσσα μοῦ ἔδωσαν ἑλληνικὴ
    τὸ σπίτι φτωχικὸ στὶς ἀμμουδιὲς τοῦ Ὁμήρου.
    Μονάχη ἔγνοια ἡ γλῶσσα μου στὶς ἀμμουδιὲς τοῦ Ὁμήρου.

    ἀπὸ τὸ Ἄξιον ἐστί
    τοῦ Ὀδυσσέα Ἐλύτη

The first stanza of Pushkin's Bronze Horseman (Russian):

    На берегу пустынных волн
    Стоял он, дум великих полн,
    И вдаль глядел. Пред ним широко
    Река неслася; бедный чёлн
    По ней стремился одиноко.
    По мшистым, топким берегам
    Чернели избы здесь и там,
    Приют убогого чухонца;
    И лес, неведомый лучам
    В тумане спрятанного солнца,
    Кругом шумел.

Šota Rustaveli's Veṗxis Ṭq̇aosani, ̣︡Th, The Knight in the Tiger's Skin (Georgian):

    ვეპხის ტყაოსანი შოთა რუსთაველი

    ღმერთსი შემვედრე, ნუთუ კვლა დამხსნას სოფლისა შრომასა, ცეცხლს, წყალსა და მიწასა, ჰაერთა თანა მრომასა; მომცნეს ფრთენი და აღვფრინდე, მივჰხვდე მას ჩემსა ნდომასა, დღისით და ღამით ვჰხედვიდე მზისა ელვათა კრთომაასა.

Tamil poetry of Subramaniya Bharathiyar: சுப்ரமணிய பாரதியார் (1882-1921):

    யாமறிந்த மொழிகளிலே தமிழ்மொழி போல் இனிதாவது எங்கும் காணோம்,
    பாமரராய் விலங்குகளாய், உலகனைத்தும் இகழ்ச்சிசொலப் பான்மை கெட்டு,
    நாமமது தமிழரெனக் கொண்டு இங்கு வாழ்ந்திடுதல் நன்றோ? சொல்லீர்!
    தேமதுரத் தமிழோசை உலகமெலாம் பரவும்வகை செய்தல் வேண்டும்.

Notes:

    The "I can eat glass" phrase and initial translations (about 30 of them) were borrowed from Ethan Mollick's I Can Eat Glass page (which disappeared on or about June 2004) and converted to UTF-8. Since Ethan's original page is gone, I should mention that his purpose was to offer travelers a phrase they could use in any country that would command a certain kind of respect, or at least get attention. See Credits for the many additional contributions since then. When submitting new entries, the word "hurt" (if you have a choice) is used in the sense of "cause harm", "do damage", or "bother", rather than "inflict pain" or "make sad". In this vein Otto Stolz comments (as do others further down; personally I think it's better for the purpose of this page to have extra entries and/or to show a greater repertoire of characters than it is to enforce a strict interpretation of the word "hurt"!):

        This is the meaning I have translated to the Swabian dialect. However, I just have noticed that most of the German variants translate the "inflict pain" meaning. The German example should read:

            "Ich kann Glas essen ohne mir zu schaden."

        rather than:

            "Ich kann Glas essen, ohne mir weh zu tun."

        (The comma fell victim to the 1996 orthographic reform, cf. http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76.

        You may wish to contact the contributors of the following translations to correct them:

            Lëtzebuergescht / Luxemburgish: Ech kan Glas iessen, daat deet mir nët wei.
            Lausitzer Mundart ("Lusatian"): Ich koann Gloos assn und doas dudd merr ni wii.
            Sächsisch / Saxon: 'sch kann Glos essn, ohne dass'sch mer wehtue.
            Bayrisch / Bavarian: I koh Glos esa, und es duard ma ned wei.
            Allemannisch: I kaun Gloos essen, es tuat ma ned weh.
            Schwyzerdütsch: Ich chan Glaas ässe, das tuet mir nöd weeh.

        In contrast, I deem the following translations *alright*:

            Ruhrdeutsch: Ich kann Glas verkasematuckeln, ohne dattet mich wat jucken tut.
            Pfälzisch: Isch konn Glass fresse ohne dasses mer ebbes ausmache dud.
            Schwäbisch / Swabian: I kå Glas frässa, ond des macht mr nix!

        (However, you could remove the commas, on account of http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76 and http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P72, respectively.)

        I guess, also these examples translate the wrong sense of "hurt", though I do not know these languages well enough to assert them definitely:

            Nederlands / Dutch: Ik kan glas eten; het doet mĳ geen pĳn. (This one has been changed)
            Kirchröadsj/Bôchesserplat: Iech ken glaas èèse, mer 't deet miech jing pieng.

        In the Romanic languages, the variations on "fa male" (it) are probably wrong, whilst the variations on "hace daño" (es) and "damaĝas" (Esperanto) are probably correct; "nocet" (la) is definitely right.

        The northern Germanic variants of "skada" are probably right, as are the Slavic variants of "škodi/шкоди" (se); however the Slavic variants of " boli" (hv) are probably wrong, as "bolena" means "pain/ache", IIRC.

    That was from July 2004. In December 2007, Otto writes again:

        Hello Frank, in days of yore, I had written:
        > "Ich kann Glas essen ohne mir zu schaden."
        > (The comma fell victim to the 1996 orthographic reform,

        cf. http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76.

        The latest revision (2006) of the official German orthography has revived the comma around infinitive clauses commencing with ohne, or 5 other conjunctions, or depending from a noun or from an announcing demonstrative (http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/regeln2006.pdf, §75). So, it's again: Ich kann Glas essen, ohne mir zu schaden.

        Best wishes,
             Otto Stolz

    The numbering of the samples is arbitrary, done only to keep track of how many there are, and can change any time a new entry is added. The arrangement is also arbitrary but with some attempt to group related examples together. Note: All languages not listed are wanted, not just the ones that say (NEEDED).

    Correct right-to-left display of these languages depends on the capabilities of your browser. The period should appear on the left. In the monospace Yiddish example, the Yiddish digraphs should occupy one character cell.

    Yoruba: The third word is Latin letter small 'j' followed by small 'e' with U+0329, Combining Vertical Line Below. This displays correctly only if your Unicode font includes the U+0329 glyph and your browser supports combining diacritical marks. The Lingala and Indic examples also include combining sequences.

    Includes Unicode 3.1 (or later) characters beyond Plane 0.

    The Classic Mongolian example should be vertical, top-to-bottom and left-to-right. But such display is almost impossible. Also no font yet exists which provides the proper ligatures and positional variants for the characters of this script, which works somewhat like Arabic.

    Taiwanese is also known as Holo or Hoklo, and is related to Southern Min dialects such as Amoy. Contributed by Henry H. Tan-Tenn, who comments, "The above is the romanized version, in a script current among Taiwanese Christians since the mid-19th century. It was invented by British missionaries and saw use in hundreds of published works, mostly of a religious nature. Most Taiwanese did not know Chinese characters then, or at least not well enough to read. More to the point, though, a written standard using Chinese characters has never developed, so a significant minority of words are represented with different candidate characters, depending on one's personal preference or etymological theory. In this sentence, for example, "-tàng", "chia̍h", "mā" and "bē" are problematic using Chinese characters. "Góa" (I/me) and "po-lê" (glass) are as written in other Sinitic languages (e.g. Mandarin, Hakka)."

    Wagner Amaral of Pinese & Amaral Associados notes that the Brazilian Portuguese sentence for "I can eat glass" should be identical to the Portuguese one, as the word "machuca" means "inflict pain", or rather "injuries". The words "faz mal" would more correctly translate as "cause harm".

    Burmese: In English the first person pronoun "I" stands for both genders, male and female. In Burmese (except in the central part of Burma) kyundaw (က္ယ္ဝန္‌တော္‌) for male and kyanma (က္ယ္ဝန္‌မ) for female. Using here a fully-compliant Unicode Burmese font -- sadly one and only one Padauk Graphite font exists -- rendering using graphite engine. Unicode 4.0 or older standard did not have some medial and vowel character; the second example has them.

    From Louise Hope, 22 November 2010:  I decided to have a go at an Inuktitut rendering, mainly in hopes of shaming someone who actually knows the language into coming up with something better. Meanwhile, try this:

    ᐊᓕᒍᖅ ᓂᕆᔭᕌᖓᒃᑯ ᓱᕋᙱᑦᑐᓐᓇᖅᑐᖓ
    aliguq nirijaraangakku suranngittunnaqtunga

    Loosely: I am able not to hurt myself whenever I eat glass.

    aliguq >> glass (uninflected because it is the patient of a transitive verb in an ergative language)
    nirijaraangakku >> "I eat him/her/it" in Frequentative mood (all one verb with inflectional ending, no affixes whatsoever)
    suranngittunnaqtunga >> suraq (do permanent harm) + nngit (verb-negator) + tunnaq (ability) + tunga (intransitive ending, making the verb passive or reflexive)

    See above about someone who knows the language, et cetera.

    Script trivia: the syllable ᙱ is a single unicode character representing the two elements ᓐ (syllable-final n) and ᖏ (syllable ngi). I think they just did it that way because it looks tidier than the expected ᓐᖏ. If your operating system didn't come with Euphemia (all-purpose UCAS font), you can download Pigiarniq. It comes with a jolly little inuksuk ᐀ that the Unicode Consortium is trying to make into a squatter.

The Quick Brown Fox... Pangrams
The "I can eat glass" sentences do not necessarily show off the orthography of each language to best advantage. In many alphabetic written languages it is possible to include all (or most) letters (or "special" characters) in a single (often nonsense) pangram. These were traditionally used in typewriter instruction; now they are useful for stress-testing computer fonts and keyboard input methods. Here are a few examples (SEND MORE):

Notes:

    Other phrases commonly used in Germany include: "Ein wackerer Bayer vertilgt ja bequem zwo Pfund Kalbshaxe" and, more recently, "Franz jagt im komplett verwahrlosten Taxi quer durch Bayern", but both lack umlauts and esszet. Previously, going for the shortest sentence that has all the umlauts and special characters, I had "Grüße aus Bärenhöfe (und Óechtringen)!" Acute accents are not used in native German words, so I was surprised to discover "Óechtringen" in the Deutsche Bundespost Postleitzahlenbuch:

        Click for full-size image (2.8MB)

    It's a small village in eastern Lower Saxony. The "oe" in this case turns out to be the Lower Saxon "lengthening e" (Dehnungs-e), which makes the previous vowel long (used in a number of Lower Saxon place names such as Soest and Itzehoe), not the "e" that indicates umlaut of the preceding vowel. Many thanks to the Óechtringen-Namenschreibungsuntersuchungskomitee (Alex Bochannek, Manfred Erren, Asmus Freytag, Christoph Päper, plus Werner Lemberg who serves as Óechtringen-Namenschreibungsuntersuchungskomiteerechtschreibungsprüfer) for their relentless pursuit of the facts in this case. Conclusion: the accent almost certainly does not belong on this (or any other native German) word, but neither can it be dismissed as dirt on the page. To add to the mystery, it has been reported that other copies of the same edition of the PLZB do not show the accent! UPDATE (March 2006): David Krings was intrigued enough by this report to contact the mayor of Ebstorf, of which Oechtringen is a borough, who responded:

        Sehr geehrter Mr. Krings,
        wenn Oechtringen irgendwo mit einem Akzent auf dem O geschrieben wurde, dann kann das nur ein Fehldruck sein. Die offizielle Schreibweise lautet jedenfalls „Oechtringen“.
        Mit freundlichen Grüssen
        Der Samtgemeindebürgermeister
        i.A. Lothar Jessel

    From Karl Pentzlin (Kochel am See, Bavaria, Germany): "This German phrase is suited for display by a Fraktur (broken letter) font. It contains: all common three-letter ligatures: ffi ffl fft and all two-letter ligatures required by the Duden for Fraktur typesetting: ch ck ff fi fl ft ll ſch ſi ſſ ſt tz (all in a manner such they are not part of a three-letter ligature), one example of f-l where German typesetting rules prohibit ligating (marked by a ZWNJ), and all German letters a...z, ä,ö,ü,ß, ſ [long s] (all in a manner such that they are not part of a two-letter Fraktur ligature)." Otto Stolz notes that "'Schloß' is now spelled 'Schloss', in contrast to 'größer' (example 4) which has kept its 'ß'. Fraktur has been banned from general use, in 1942, and long-s (ſ) has ceased to be used with Antiqua (Roman) even earlier (the latest Antiqua-ſ I have seen is from 1913, but then I am no expert, so there may well be a later instance." Later Otto confirms the latter theory, "Now I've run across a book “Deutsche Rechtschreibung” (edited by Lutz Mackensen) from 1954 (my reprint is from 1956) that has kept the Antiqua-ſ in its dictionary part (but neither in the preface nor in the appendix)."

    Diaeresis is not used in Iberian Portuguese.

    From Yurio Miyazawa: "This poetry contains all the sounds in the Japanese language and used to be the first thing for children to learn in their Japanese class. The Hiragana version is particularly neat because it covers every character in the phonetic Hiragana character set." Yurio also sent the Kanji version:

        色は匂へど 散りぬるを
        我が世誰ぞ 常ならむ
        有為の奥山 今日越えて
        浅き夢見じ 酔ひもせず

Accented Cyrillic:

(This section contributed by Vladimir Marinov.)

In Bulgarian it is desirable, customary, or in some cases required to write accents over vowels. Unfortunately, no computer character sets contain the full repertoire of accented Cyrillic letters. With Unicode, however, it is possible to combine any Cyrillic letter with any combining accent. The appearance of the result depends on the font and the rendering engine. Here are two examples.

    Той видя бялата коса́ по главата и́ и ко́са на рамото и́, и ре́че да и́ рече́: "Пара́та по́ па́ри от па́рата, не ща пари́!", но си поми́сли: "Хей, помисли́ си! А́ и́ река, а́ е скочила в тази река, която щеше да тече́, а не те́че."

    По пъ́тя пъту́ват кю́рди и югославя́ни.

When submissions arrive by email encoded in some other character set (Latin-1, Latin-2, KOI, various PC code pages, JEUC, etc), I use the TRANSLATE command of C-Kermit on the Unix host (where I read my mail) to convert the character set to UTF-8 (I could also use Kermit 95 for this; it has the same TRANSLATE command). That's it -- no "Web authoring" tools, no locales, no "smart" anything. It's just plain text, nothing more. By the way, there's nothing special about EMACS -- any text editor will do, providing it allows entry of arbitrary 8-bit bytes as text, including the 0x80-0x9F "C1" range. EMACS 21.1 and later actually support UTF-8; earlier versions don't know about it and display the octal codes; either way is OK for this purpose.

    From: "Bruno DEDOMINICIS" <b.dedominicis@cite-sciences.fr>
    Subject: Je peux manger du verre, cela ne me fait pas mal.

    I just found out your website and it makes me feel like proposing an interpretation of the choice of this peculiar phrase.

    Glass is transparent and can hurt as everyone knows. The relation between people and civilisations is sometimes effusional and more often rude. The concept of breaking frontiers through globalization, in a way, is also an attempt to deny any difference. Isn't "transparency" the flag of modernity? Nothing should be hidden any more, authority is obsolete, and the new powers are supposed to reign through loving and smiling and no more through coercion...

    Eating glass without pain sounds like a very nice metaphor of this attempt. That is, frontiers should become glass transparent first, and be denied by incorporating them. On the reverse, it shows that through globalization, frontiers undergo a process of displacement, that is, when they are not any more speakable, they become repressed from the speech and are therefore incorporated and might become painful symptoms, as for example what happens when one tries to eat glass.

    The frontiers that used to separate bodies one from another tend to divide bodies from within and make them suffer.... The chosen phrase then appears as a denial of the symptom that might result from the destitution of traditional frontiers.

    Best,
    Bruno De Dominicis, Paris, France

Meme

IGP alum Ethan Mollick ’97 created the “I Can Eat Glass” project during his time at Harvard. The project turned into one of the first famous Internet memes, and the original page was housed on the IGP website for several years before being taken down. Now, it is back where it belongs, and the current members of IGP have taken up the task of keeping the project going. Updates to come, but for now enjoy Ethan’s original work.

The Idea

The concept of the “I Can Eat Glass” Project is simple– to compile a list of ways to say the phrase “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me” in various languages. Pretty easy, eh?

The Philosophy

This Project is, of course, completely trivial. Still, I feel a need to justify it, so pick your favorite reason, or give me your suggestions by email or comment form:

* The Project is based on the idea that people in a foreign country have an irresistable urge to try to say something in the indigenous tongue. In most cases, however, the best a person can do is “Where is the bathroom?” a phrase that marks them as a tourist. But, if one says “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me,” you will be viewed as an insane native, and treated with dignity and respect.
* The Project is a challenge to the human spirit, in much the same way as the Apollo Program or the Panama Canal was, except that it involves much less digging and slightly less spaceflight.
* The Project is part of an attempt to procrastinate when I should be doing reading.
* The Project is a product of the social framework in which it was created, and thus by studying the Project, you are truly studying Western Civilization.
* The Project is the result of high technology in the hands of people who have no idea what to do with it.

The Project

The Project lists the language, the location in which it is spoken, how it would be written in the language (if the tongue uses the Roman alphabet), and a transliteration if available. Transliterations are in italics.

Main Entries

Afrikaans

Spoken in: South Africa, Namibia
In Afrikaans: “Ek kan glas eet, dit maak my nie seer nie.”
Alternately: “Ek kan glas eet, dit kan my nie seermaak nie.”
Pronounciation: The g’s are like the gutteral Dutch sound but “eet” is a long “ee”, not the “ay” of Dutch. “My” is “may”.
Note: This language is one of the most recent major languages, derived from Dutch in this century.

Arabic

Spoken in: North Africa and the Middle East
In Transliterated Algerian Arabic: Nakdar nakoul ezjaj ou ma youjaach.
In Egyptian Arabic: Ana momken aakol el-ezaz, we dah ma beyewgaaneash
Notes: Egyptian Arabic is the most popular Arabic dialect, this is due tothe huge backing of T.V. and radio all-over the Arab world. It is also spoken by 50 million people as a mother tongue which puts it on the top of the list of all arabic dialects. Unfortunately anything that has to be written will be translated to classical form first that’s why this and other Arabic dialects tend to be only spoken.

Aracnol

Spoken in: Online Portuguese community
In Aracnol: “poh sukumer vidro. nam-u mieh dzagradahvel.”
Pronounced: “paw soo koomair vee-drew. nown mee Eh dzu grudah vell.”
Note: Aracnol is an artificial language, developed when Portuguese-speakers were unable to use accents in email messages. It has since developed its own grammers and expressions. Compare with Portuguese below.

Aragones

Spoken in: Aragon (Spanish State, Europe)
In Aragones: Puedo (en) minchar (de) beire, no me’n fa mal
Pronounced: puedo (en) minCHar (de) beire, no men fa mal. (CH=English T)
Compare with Spanish below.

Armenian

Spoken in: Armenia, Lebanon, Iran, Turkey
In Armenian: Abagee grnam oodel yev eendzy tche venassér.

Note: The above is represented by bytes of eight bits each (how the string “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me” would actually be stored in memory). Each byte is one character. Conveniently enough, bytes are organized into words of four bytes each. Curiously, the phrase is exactly nine words long in computer memory.

Chinese (Mandarin)

Spoken in: China
In Mandarin:
Transliteration (using the Pinyin system): “Wo ke yi chi bo li, wo bu huei sho shang”
Notes: There are different systems for converting Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese, Haka, etc.) speech to roman text, one of them is Pinyin. As an example ‘I’ or ‘me’ in Mandarin is written ‘wo’ in pinyin. Every sound like ‘wo’ can be pronounced in 4 ‘tunes’, or changes in tone. In this case ‘wo’ is in the third tone. To pronounce it, first the pitch of your voice goes down a little, then rises. In pinyin this is pictured by placing a ‘v’ on top of the o (like ô but just the other way around). Unfortunately, this is currently not supported by HTML characters.

Czech

Spoken in: Czech Republic
In Czech: “Muzu jíst sklo; to mi neskodí.”
Pronounced: MOO-zhoo yeest skloh; toh mee NEH-shkoh-dee.

Pronounced: MOO-zhoo yeest skloh, toh mee nyeets NEH-oo-dye-lah.
Notes: In “muzu,” there is a little circle over the u (like the å in Swedish or Norwegian). Also, there is an inverted circumflex over the z (an upside-down ^). There is an inverted circumflex over the s in “neskodí”m and in the alternate version, over the second e in “neudelá”. The first version is generally used to describe realistic action.

Literally: “I can eat glass, it does not hurt (me) at all.”

French

Spoken in: France, Canada, various former colonies
In French: “Je peux manger du verre, cela ne me fait pas mal.”
However: French distinguishes between being able to physically and knowing how to. “Je sais” means “I can” in the second sense. Secondly, French distinguishes between the generic “le verre” (“glass” in general) and the particular “du verre” (“(some) glass”). ie if you know how to go about it properly, you can eat glass without it hurting (“Je sais… le verre”).
This may thus be more correct: “Je sais manger le verre; cela ne me fait pas mal.”
In modern colloquial French: “Ch’peux manger du verre, ca m’fait pas mal.”
In seventeenth-century French alexandrine verse (as spoken by Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, and Molière): “Je puis manger du verre; cela ne me nuit point.”
Note: The previously displayed alexandrine has 13 syllables. Although Classical French tolerated13, 12 syllables was, and is now, the norm.
Thus: “Je mange le verre; cela ne me nuit point.”

Frisian

Spoken in: Province of Friesland, Netherlands
In Frisian: ik kin gl^es ite, it docht me net sear
Pronounced: ick kin gle-es ee-tuh, ut doxt mu net seer

Pronounced: taw MAY in ON glinna ah IH-heh; nee kurrun SHAY IS-chyok no em-OCK UR-em
Note: This is a more natural saying which translates as “I can eat glass; It doesn’t put me in or out”
The grammatically correct form would be: “Tá mé in ann gloine a ithe; Ní gortaíonn sé mé ar bith”
Literally: I can eat glass; It does not wound me at all.

Alternately: Watashiwa garasu o taberarete, watashi o kizutsukemasen.
Alternately: Watashiwa garasu o taberarete, kizutsukemasen.
Alternately: Garasu o taberete, kizutsukemasen.

Kelabit

Spoken in: Sarawak, Malaysia
In Kelabit: “Uih kereb kuman gelas, na’am inih belu’an na’an.”
Literally: “I can eat glass, not it hurt later.”
Notes: Kelabit is a language from the interior of Borneo. They had no word for glass before the British arrived during WWII. Go here for some more information. Given the nature of the subject matter (eating glass) the translator assumed that most native Kelabit speakers would say that it would make them “sick” (as opposed to hurt or injured) or rather “not make mesick” (na’am inih naru’ ma’it). The word glass in this context would probably be confused with a drinking glass. The only other word that they have for glass is the one meaning windowpane, which they have borrowed from Malaysian (Kelingai).

Transliterated: HIvje’ mep vISoplaH. mu’oy’moHbe’.

Spoken in: This is an invented language, generated from Loglan, which was described in Scientific American in the 1960s. by the Logical Language Group
In Lojban: “mi ka’e citka loi blaci .i la’edi’u na xrani mi”
Pronounced: mee KAhey SHITkah loi BLAshi (pause) ee laheDIhoo na KHRAni mee.
Pronounciation: the apostrophe is an unvoiced stop, usually rendered much like the English “h”, the “x” is like German “ch”, and the “c” is like English “sh”. Vowels are like the European long vowels. The period represents a pause.

LPC

Spoken in: MUDs
In LPC: inherit OBJECT;

void create() {
set_id({“glass”, “broken glass”, “piece of glass”, “piece of broken glass”});

Transliteration: “ml foti yeh ba darega, ` ml ki nggweh”

In Neo-Melanesian: “Mipela inap kaikai gilas na em i no inap killim mi liklik”

Killim Liklik = Hurt a bit
Killim = Hurt
Killim Pinis (Kill ‘im finish) = Hurt a lot
Killim I dai = Kill him dead
Second Note: This is the ‘Pidgin’ languages of the Melanesian Pacific Isles. A mixture of German, English, Dutch and various indigenous languages hung on a melanesian grammar frame.

Alternately: Moge jesc szklo, mnie to nie boli.
Pronounced: MO-ga yeshtch shkwo, mnia to nia BO-lee.
Notes: In the 1st sentence, you can omit “Ja”, which means “I”, but is understood anyway from the form of the verb “moge”=”I can.” Another thing: “boli” means “hurts” in the physical sense of pain, while “szkodzi” means “harm” or “injure” or “bother” in a general sense.

In Brazilian coloquial Portuguese: “Consigo comer vidro. Não me machuca.”
Pronunciation: ay-oo kon-SEE-goo koo-MAYR VEE-droo. nown mee mah-SHOO-kah.

Pronounced: ‘Ew ‘sow ka’pas de ko’mer ‘bidro — ‘nõN me las’tima

Even though its spoken varieties have been strongly Castilianized through the centuries, structurally Galizan is basically Portuguese. Still, a strong case can be made that it is an independent language.

Saint Lucian Patwa or Kweyol

Spoken in: St. Lucia
In Patwa: “Mwen sa manjé glas, i pa ka fé mwen mal.”
Note from Paul Garrett, anthropologist: St. Lucia is an island of 238 sqaure miles, a neighbor of Martinique (to the north), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (to the south), and Barbados (to the east). English is the official language now, but St. Lucia was colonized by the French from the late seventeenth century until the English won it away from the French in 1814–and even after that, the French colonial influence remained stronger than the English for several decades. (It’s now, as of 1979, an independent state within the Commonwealth.) A French-lexicon creole is still widely spoken–some old rural people are still monolingual in the language. It’s generally referred to as “Patwa” by its speakers, and that’s what I generally call it too. But there’s a movement afoot to get people to start calling it “Kweyol” (acute accent on the E, grave accent on the O) as a matter of national pride, since some think that “Patwa” is derogatory, a relic of the colonial past. You can call it by either/both of those labels, or you can call it “St. Lucian French-lexified creole”, which is more technical but more descriptive.

Scottish Gaelic

Spoken in: Scotland, by about 80,000 speakers
In Scottish Gaelic: ‘S urrainn dhomh gloinne ithe; cha ghoirtich i mi.

In Sindarin: “Bathathon heled, im ú-cirath.”
Pronounced: BA-tha-thon HEH-led, eem oo-KEER-ath
Literally: “I will consume glass, it will not hurt me.”
Note: The Languages of Tolkien’s Middle-Earth by Ruth S. Noel suggests that the future tense can be used to imply ability. “Bath-” is a back-formed verb stem meaning “to consume,” derived from Quenya (a related Elvish language) vasa according to patterns established by other words.

Singlish (Corrrupted Singaporean English)

Spoken in: Singapore
In Singlish: “Can eat glass, lah, never hurt me, hoh!”
Pronounced: /ken EE’ gras lah, NEH-ver hu’ me, HOH/
Pronounciation note: Vowels clipped and nasalised. The /’/ represents a glottal stop. The “hoh” is pronounced entirely through the nose.
Alternatively: “Eat glass also can! I never kanah, wan!”
Pronounced: /Ea’ glas aw-so can! I NEH-vuh’ ka-NA, WAAHN!/
Pronounciation note: Same as before. “Kanah” is a word of dubious spelling, origin and meaning, generally implying punishment, pain, and other such unpleasantness, and enjoys widespread use in army barracks.
Malay-based alternative: “Makan glass, BOLEH! I don’t sakit, lor!”
Pronounced: /ma-kan glas BOH-lay! I don’ sah-ki’, laaw/
Literally: “Eat glass can! I don’t hurt”
Note: The words “lor”, “lah”, “wan” etc. are universal interjections and are usually interchangeable. Mix and match the versions at will!
Note on Singlish: Not quite a dialect; it is a controversial symptom of the infiltration of Malay, Tamil and various Chinese dialects into the old colonial language, English. The grammar of this alleged “language” is highly malleable (and has been condemned by the Authorities).

Oddities

In this section resides the assorted suggestions that did not really fit anywhere within the traditional ICEGP framework. This section is also different from other parts of the Project because I WILL list contributers’ names directly with their submssions (unless they do not want it), since all of these contributions are so… um… unique.

In Lunfardo: Yo puedo manyar driovi, no me hace un carajo, no me hace.
Notes: Yo puedo=”I can”; manyar=”eat” (slang), driovi is from “vidrio” which means glass, so driovi is like saying “ssgla”; no me hace=”it doesn’t”; un carajo=a rude word for nothing… also an insult (not THAT rude); no me hace=people use to repeat some part of the paragraph.

Newfie

Spoken in: Newfoundland, which appears to be part of Canada
In Newfie: “Shair I kin it glass, b’ye, it dohn do me no ‘arm.”
Note: I have had more submissions for Newfie than anything else. It appears that Canadians are obsessed with making fun of Newfoundland. Thus, to pacify Our Neighbors To The North, I am including one version of Newfie. One question– who do people from Newfoundland make fun of? This question has now been answered Newfies apparently make fun of people from Toronto and tell bad lightbulb jokes about them.
Submitted by about 10 Canadians, this version by Kerilyn Cole

Newspeak

Spoken in: Oceania (from George Orwell’s _1984_)
In Newspeak: I can eat glass. It does not hurt me.
Pronounced: Like “I can eat glass. It does not hurt me.”
Notes: Newspeak was constructed to restrict thought to _goodthink_ (thought in line with the interests of the state) and to allow for easy expression of _goodthinkful_ ideas. The phrase comes through largely unscathed because it expresses a simple mechanical relationship, the only real change being in the punctuation. However, if made as an actual statement in real life, this would probably be tied in with the philosophical viewpoint of the speaker, hence something such as “_Glass does not hurt goodthinkful eaters_” or “_Unownlifers eat glass unhurtfully_,” which would require some _doublethink_ to rationalize. Some might even say “I am a doubleplusgood unhurtful eater of glass.”

Opposite Day

Spoken in: elementary school
In Opposite Day: “I can’t eat glass and it does hurt me. It’s Opposite Day.”

Awards

The ICEGP has received some…. well, honors is not the right word, perhaps recognition:

* It was featured among the Useless Pages on the World Wide Web
* It has been listed as providing “great armchair Whorfian speculation material” by the Humanist Discussion Group, which I think is a good thing.
* There was a short, on-line article on the Project in “Fresh Stuff,” a neat e-zine.
* It has also been reviewed by the Learning Lab section of the June issue of Netguide magazine which gave it a coveted single star, which apparently means that it preferable to shoot oneself instead of seeing this page. Obviously, Netguide is a magazine of little class and should be avoided.
* It is a teaching tool at the University of Texas-Austin!
* Thanks for making this the #9 site on the Harvard Web. ICEGP accounts for almost half a percent of all traffic on the www.fas.harvard.edu site. (Note: this is probably no longer true, but we aim to change that!)
* The project has also been featured in “Yahoo” magazine! Cool, no?
